'''2.Data formatting
Python libraries represent missing numbers as nan which is short for “not a number”. Most libraries (including scikit-learn) will give you an error if you try to build a model using data with missing values. One of the common solution to get around this issue is to impute or fill in the missing value with a number or value 
of same format. From the given dataset, find the missing values(Nan/NA/-/Nil) and change those values into an appropriate number.'''
